# TwitterApp

Coursework of week 1 of Introduction to Modern App Development 2016 Fellowship conducted by Hasura. 

We were required to design a prototype of the UI similar to the Twitter mobile app. 
This has been done using React Native and can be run by downloading the expo emulator on an android phone. 

It is a three screen app comprising of the home feed of a user, the user profile and the discover page. 
Features such as drawer navigation and linking between pages has been demonstrated in this project.
